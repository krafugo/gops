# Welcome

Thank you for choosing GOPS for your web development needs.

## Database Setup

It looks like you chose to set up your application using a database! Fantastic!

The first thing you need to do is open up the "database.yml" file and edit it to use the correct usernames, passwords, hosts, etc... that are appropriate for your environment.

You will also need to make sure that **you** start/install the database of your choice.
